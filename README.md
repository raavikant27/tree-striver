# Striver-A2Z
This Sheet is made for people who want to learn DSA from A to Z for free in a well-organized and structured manner by Raj Vikramaditya(Striver Bhaiya) & their Take You Forward Team.

There might be a lot of existing sheets in the market, but this is better in terms of structure, and the number of questions we will be doing. We just donâ€™t teach the basics, we cover all the varieties, and we go in super depth for each topic, so that you are well prepared for any of your interviews.
